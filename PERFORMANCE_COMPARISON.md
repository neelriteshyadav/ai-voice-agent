## Scalability Comparison

### Horizontal Scaling

**Optimized Architecture**:
```bash
# Easy scaling with Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d --scale agent-worker=20

# Or with custom script
./scripts/scale.sh up 20
```

**Kubernetes**:
```bash
# Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
kubectl autoscale deployment voice-agents --min=10 --max=50 --cpu-percent=70
```

**Serverless**:
- Automatic scaling based on concurrent requests
- No manual intervention required
- Potential cold start issues at scale

**Monolithic**:
- Vertical scaling only (more CPU/memory)
- Limited by single process constraints
- Requires application-level concurrency management

    cpu: "0.5"
    memory: "512Mi"

# Connection pooling
deepgram_pool_size: 20
elevenlabs_pool_size: 20
redis_pool_size: 10
```

### Monolithic Architecture Tuning
```python
# Async optimization
MAX_CONCURRENT_CALLS = 80
CONNECTION_POOL_SIZE = 50
WORKER_THREADS = 4

# Memory management
import gc
gc.set_threshold(700, 10, 10)
```

### Kubernetes Tuning
```yaml
# HPA configuration
spec:
  minReplicas: 10
  maxReplicas: 50
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70

## Conclusion

The **Optimized Architecture** provides the best overall performance for the 100 concurrent calls requirement:

✅ **Strengths**:
- Meets all performance targets
- Excellent reliability and scalability
- Manageable operational complexity
- Proven in production environments

⚠️ **Trade-offs**:
- Higher resource usage than monolithic
- More complex than serverless for simple cases
- Requires container orchestration knowledge

For production deployment targeting 100 concurrent calls with <600ms latency, the optimized horizontally-scaled architecture is the recommended approach, offering the best balance of performance, reliability, and operational manageability.
